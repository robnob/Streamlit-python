- st.title("Hola Mundo") 
- save it as app.py
3. **In the terminal:**
- streamlit run app.py
- it would open a navigator with the web page title
4. Add an exlamation point to "Hola Mundo!" and save the file, in the browser selects "Alwys rerun" so that any change saved in the file is shown on it (live coding). In this way it is going to use the deltas and not to re-charge the whole page again.
